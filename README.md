### Features

> Save and Load

Once you save a game, your placement on the map, inventory (what you have, and what was taken) and the amount of :yen: you have is kept track of in `.txt` files that come along with the game.

You can manipulate the files and beat the game instantly, but what's the fun in that.

> Inventory Management

Also kept track in `.txt` files. Items in your inventory can be taken by the :fox_face: Swiper-like Inugami. 

> Animation and Player Movement

Drew out multiple frames of the sprite, and depending on what movement key was pressed, a timer would run and quickly display different frames of the sprite to mimic walking. 

> Collison Detection

Placed transparent boxes to where the walls should be, and checked if Kohina was colliding with any of them.
